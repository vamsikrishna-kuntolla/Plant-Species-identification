# Plant-Species-identification using Deep Convolutional Neural Network
We achieved accuracy of 96% using Flavia leaf dataset.
Steps followed during this process are:
1.In first step, we prepared a data.pickle file which contains features and labels of flavia leaf dataset(utils.ipynb).
2.In second step, we loaded the data from first file and build the classifier(classifier.ipynb).
3.In third step,the model will be saved for further use(model.h5).
4.Finally, model will be evaluated and the prediction is performed on the random images of dataset(detect.py).
